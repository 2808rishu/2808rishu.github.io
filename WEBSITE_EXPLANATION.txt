WEBSITE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONALITY EXPLANATION
==============================================

This document explains how the three main files (HTML, CSS, JS) work together to create the resume website.

1. INDEX.HTML - Structure and Content
-------------------------------------
The HTML file serves as the skeleton of the website, containing all the content and defining the structure.

Main Components:
- Header with movie quotes
- Navigation tabs (Home, Education, Skills, Experience, Hobbies, Contact)
- Tab content sections with personal information
- PDF embedding for certificates
- Footer with copyright information
- Links to CSS and JavaScript files

Key Features:
- Tab-based navigation system that shows/hides content sections
- Interactive certificate viewer that expands when clicked
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- External links to social media profiles and contact information

2. STYLE.CSS - Presentation and Design
--------------------------------------
The CSS file controls the visual appearance of the website.

Main Styling Features:
- Dark theme with red accent colors
- Responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Dark mode support with different color schemes
- Consistent styling across all sections (education, skills, experience, etc.)

Specific Styles:
- Typography and color schemes
- Layout and spacing
- Button and navigation styling
- Card-based design for content sections
- PDF viewer styling
- Mobile-responsive adjustments

3. SCRIPT.JS - Interactivity and Functionality
---------------------------------------------
The JavaScript file adds dynamic behavior to the website.

Main Functions:
- Tab navigation system (showTab function)
  * Switches between content sections
  * Updates active tab highlighting
  * Smooth scrolling to top of content

- PDF viewer toggle (togglePdf function)
  * Shows/hides certificate PDFs when titles are clicked
  * Uses robust detection of current display state

- Scroll to top button
  * Appears when user scrolls down the page
  * Smoothly scrolls back to top when clicked

- Security features
  * Disables right-click context menu
  * Prevents common keyboard shortcuts for copying content

How the Files Work Together:
---------------------------
1. HTML provides the structure and content
2. CSS applies styling and layout to the HTML elements
3. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior

When a user visits the website:
1. Browser loads index.html
2. HTML references style.css for styling
3. HTML references script.js for functionality
4. User interacts with tabs, PDF viewers, and other elements
5. JavaScript handles user interactions and updates the display
6. CSS ensures everything looks visually appealing

File Dependencies:
- index.html depends on style.css and script.js
- style.css depends on the HTML element classes and IDs
- script.js depends on HTML element IDs and classes for DOM manipulation
